<h3 align=center>Online Screens Overview</h3>
<p>The various multiplayer matchmaking screens are provided as tabs on a single root screen.  Each tab
allows you to access an aspect of the multiplayer system.  The root screen itself has several
features that are available no matter which tab is currently selected:</p>

<p><i>Logout Button</i>. Clicking the Logout button, located in the lower right, will return you to the
Login Screen.  You may click on this button at any time to exit Sierra Online.</p>

<p><i>Game Logo</i>. Clicking the Game logo, located in the upper right, will open
your Internet browser to the official game site.</p>

<p><i>Sierra Logo</i>. Clicking the Sierra logo, located in the lower left, will open
your Internet browser to the Sierra Entertainment home page.</p>

<p><i>The Banner</i>. If you have <i>Show Banners</i> turned on (see the
<a href="OptionsTab.html">Options Tab</a> for more information), you may click on the banner,
displayed on the bottom of the screen, to open your Internet browser to the site
associated with the banner.</p>

<p>In addition, you may always get help via the <a href="HelpTab.html">Help Tab</a> which is always
the right-most tab available.
