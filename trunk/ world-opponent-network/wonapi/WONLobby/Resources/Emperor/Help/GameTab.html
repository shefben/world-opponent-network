<h3 align=center>Game Tab</h3>
<p>The Game Options tab allows you to set up the game options and/or chat with other players
before the game actually starts.  The game host may configure game and player options,
as needed.
Players may configure their individual options as needed.  When everyone is ready, the host may
start the game.</p>

<p>The upper portion of the game tab contains the game <a href="Chat.html#_RefChatWindow">chat window</a>
and the game <a href="Chat.html#_RefUserList">user list</a>.  The lower portion consists of tabs
for the game/player Options, as well as additional Chat tabs.</p>  

<h4><a name="_RefSetup">Setting Up The Game</a></h4>
<p>Before a game can be started by the host, it must be set up--this includes the host setting all
game and player options, and other players setting their own options (if any).  Most options will have
default values and will not need to be set directly.  Once all options are set, each player, other
than the host, must select <i>Ready</i> by clicking the button on the upper portion of the game tab.
Once all players are ready, the host may click <i>Start Game</i> (also located on the upper portion
of the game tab).</p>

<p>Note that players who are ready will have the <a href="Icons.html">Ready Icon</a> displayed next
to their names in the <a href="#_RefGameChat">game user list</a>.  The host's <i>Start Game</i> button
will be disabled until all players are ready.  Players may also click the <i>Ready</i> button again
to mark themselves as unready and thus prevent the host from starting the game.</p>

<p>The host may ban a troublesome player (like one who won't click ready) at any time by selecting
the user's name in the <a href="#_RefGameChat">game user list</a> and clicking the <i>Ban</i> button
(located at the bottom of the game user list).  This will eject the user from the game and prevent
them from returning.</p>

<p>Any player may leave the game at any time before it is started by the host by selecting the
<i>Leave Game</i> button (located on the upper portion of the game tab).  The host may
dissolve the
game at any time before it is started by selecting the <i>Dissolve Game</i> button (also located on
the upper portion of the game tab).</p>

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefGameOptions">Game Options</a></h4>
<p>The Game Options tab is located on the lower portion of the game setup screen.  This tab contains
options and information that are common to all players.  Only the captain has the ability to modify
these options.</p>

<p>The <i>Campaign</i> field displays the name of the campaign scenario that the captain has chosen
to play.  A description of this campaign appears in the center window.  The specific <i>goals</i> of
the campaign, if any, are listed on the far right.  If you are the captain, you may select from the
list of available campaigns.</p>

<p>The <i>Game Type</i> field selects whether this is a <i>New Game</i>, or a continuation of a
<i>Saved Game</i>.  If the captain has selected <i>Saved Game</i> you must have a copy of the saved
game file to play.</p>

<p>The <i>Difficulty</i> field controls the strength of the computer opponents.

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefPlayerOptions">Player Options</a></h4>
<p>The <i>Player Options</i> tab is located on the lower portion of the game  setup screen.  This
tab contains options that are specific to each player.  Each player may only modify his or her own
options.</p>

<p>The <i>Username</i> field has three options and can only be modified by the captain.  <i>Open</i>
means that this slot is available to joining players.  <i>Computer</i> means that no player may enter
this slot as it is reserved for computer use.  Captains may use this option when they wish to limit
the number of players that may join.  <i>Note: Use caution when modifying these fields. If a player
is already occupying a slot that you modify to Computer, that player will be removed from
the game!</i></p>

<p>Each user must select a <i>city</i> and a <i>zodiac</i> before they may start the game; no two
players may select the same city.  If two players have selected the same city, their city fields will
highlight in red and the captain will not be able to start the game.  Players may have the same
<i>zodiac</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefGameChat">Game Chat and User List</a></h4>
<p>All chat in the game <a href="Chat.html#_RefChatWindow">chat window</a> will be delivered to all
players in the game (unless whispered).  The game <a href="Chat.html#_RefUserList">user list</a>
supports some additional features over a normal user list: the game host has the
<a href="Icons.html">Captain icon</a> next to username and is always displayed at the top of the
list.  Each player in the game list (other than the host), displays their ping to the game host to
the right of their name.</p>

If you are the game host and have chosen the <i>Ask To Join</i>
<a href="EntryRestrictions.html">entry restriction</a>, then a message will appear in your game chat
window whenever a user wishes to join your game.  You can click on <i>accept</i> or <i>reject</i> in
the message to allow the user to join or dismiss them.

<h4><a name="_RefTeamChat">Team Chat</a></h4>
<p>The Team Chat tab allows you to <a href="Chat.html">chat</a> between members of your team (if any).&nbsp;
All chat on this tab goes only to you and your team members (excluding whispers).  Note that there
is no separate User list for the Team Chat tab.</p>

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefLobbyChat">Lobby Chat</a></h4>
<p>The Lobby Chat tab allows you to <a href="Chat.html">chat</a> with users in your current
Lobby/room.
All chat on this tab goes to all users in your Lobby room (excluding whispers).  You can use this tab
to ask other users to come join your game or to just to chat with others as you wait for your game
to begin.</p>
