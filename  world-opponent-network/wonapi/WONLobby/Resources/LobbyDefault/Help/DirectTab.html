<h3 align=center>Direct Tab</h3>
<p>The Direct Tab is used to join and host direct connection (connect by IP address) games.  It
contains a <a href="GameBrowser.html">Game Browser</a> that lists any direct connect games you
have defined.  In addition, there are two additional buttons available:</p>

<ul type=circle>
<li><p><i>Add</i>.  Displays the <i>Add</i> dialog to add a new direct connection game to the
<a href="GameBrowser.html">game browser</a>.  The dialog allows you to specify the game address as
IP:port and an optional name.  If no name is entered, the address will also be used as the name.
When all information is entered, click <i>Add</i> to add the new game to the browser.  Or you may click
<i>Cancel</i> to abort.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Remove</i>. Remove is only available when a game is selected in the
<a href="GameBrowser.html">game browser</a>.  Click <i>Remove</i> to delete the selected game from the
game browser permanently.  Note that you may also right-click on a game and select <i>Remove</i>
to delete it as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note: you must have an active Internet connection in order to play direct connection games.</b></p>
