<h3 align=center>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>The following covers some of the more common problems you may encounter when playing online.  Note
that fan sites or the official message boards are a good source of help for online play problems.  You
can also contact tech support for assistance.</p>

<h4>I get an error whenever I try to join a game.</h4>

<p>You probably are behind some sort of <a href="Security.html">Internet Security</a> that is blocking
outgoing connections and will need to open ports or reduce the security before you can play.  You can
check the <a href="OptionsTab.html#_RefHosting">Options Tab</a> to see if Internet Security is present.</p>

<h4>When I try to host a game, I get a warning stating that connections to my machine could not be
verified.</h4>

<p>You probably are behind some sort of <a href="Security.html">Internet Security</a> and will need

<h4>When I join a game, I experience a lot of lag, game play pauses, or I get disconnected.</h4>

<p>Your latency to the game host is probably too high.  Generally you want to choose games with good
pings to join.  When selecting a game on the <a href="GameBrowser.html">Game Browser</a>, try to choose
games with more bars in the ping column.  If all games have low bars, your ISP may be experiencing
difficulty.</p>

<h4>Another user is being annoying or offensive to me.</h4>

<p>You can add the user to your <a href="Ignore.html">ignore list</a> using the
<a href="Chat.html#_RefCommands">ignore chat command</a>.</p>

<h4>The user I ignored just created a new account and is still harassing me.</h4>

<p>You can add the user's installed game to your <a href="Ignore.html">block list</a> using the
<a href="Chat.html#_RefCommands">block chat command</a>.</p>

<h4>When I try to log on or play direct connection games, I get an Invalid CDKey error.</h4>

<p>Your CDKey is not valid.  You may have mistyped it during the installation of the game.  You will
need to re-install and be very sure to enter the CDKey correctly.  If all else fails, you may
contact technical support for assistance.</p>

<h4>Sometimes when I try to log on or play direct connection games, I get a CDKey in use error.</h4>

<p>Someone else is playing online using your CDKey.  Only 1 person may play online with a given
CDKey at a time.  If you believe your CDKey has been stolen, contact technical support.</p>
