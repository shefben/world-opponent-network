<h3 align=center>Game Browser</h3>
<p>The Game Browser displays games that are available to join and/or in-progress.  It is available on
several screens including the <a href="LobbyTab.html">Lobby Tab</a>, <a href="LanTab.html">LAN Tab</a>,
and <a href="DirectTab.html">Direct Tab</a>.  The game browser consists of a multi-column list box;
each row of the list box represents a game.  The various columns provide summary information about each
game.  If <i>Show Games in Progress </i>Option is enabled, in-progress games are displayed in a disabled color.</p>

<p>Below the list box on the left side is a summary of the games available.  It lists the number of
games displayed as well as the total games available (displayed and not displayed) in
parentheses.  If
one or more games is currently being refreshed, the number of servers refreshed out of total is
displayed.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefButtons">Game Browser Buttons</a></h4>
<p>The following buttons are available below the list box:</p>

<ul type=circle>
<li><p><i>Join Game</i>.  Attempts to join the currently selected game.  This button is only enabled
if there is a game selected, and it allows you to join.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Host Game</i>.  Hosts a new game on your machine.  The
<a href="HostGame.html">Host Game Dialog</a> will be displayed.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Refresh List</i>.  Refreshes the current lists of games.  This may take awhile if the number
of games is large.  Note that while a Refresh of any games is in progress, this button will display
<i>Stop Refresh</i>.  Clicking will abort the Refresh of any remaining games.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="_RefColumns">Game Browser Columns</a></h4>
<p>Each column of the game browser provides information about the game; most are self explanatory.  The
following columns contain special information:</p>

<ul type=circle>
<li><p><i>Info</i>.  The Info column is the left-most column.  It contains a triangle
which may be
clicked to toggle display of extended game details.  It will also contain an <a href="Icons.html">icon</a>
if the game has any <a href="EntryRestrictions.html">entry restrictions</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Skill</i>.  The Skill column is the second-left-most column.  If a game has been
 designated for a certain skill level (novice, intermediate, advanced, expert), an appropriate
<a href="Icons.html">icon</a> will be displayed.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Ping</i>.  The Ping column is the right-most column.  It shows a measurement of the latency
between your machine and the game machine.  The display is a series of green bars; the more green
bars, the lower the latency (and the better the game will play).  If a game is not responding, the
Ping column will contain the Not Responding <a href="Icons.html">icon</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="_RefGameInfo">Joining Games and Game Information</a></h4>
<p>You can attempt to join a game by double-clicking it, by right-clicking it and
selecting <i>connect</i>, or by selecting it and pressing the <i>Join Game</i> button.  Note that some games have
<a href="EntryRestrictions.html">entry restrictions</a> that may prevent you from joining.  If joining
is successful, you will be taken to the <a href="GameTab.html">Game Tab</a>; if joining fails, an
appropriate error will be displayed.</p>

<p>You may click on the triangle in the left column of game to toggle display of extended details.  Note
that opening extended details may take a few seconds as the game must be queried.  Extended details
are displayed directly below the game in the Game Browser.

<p>You may right click on a game for a popup menu of commands.  The available commands will include:
connect, refresh server, show details and refresh list.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefSort">Sorting and Filtering</a></h4>
<p>The list of games may be sorted by any column.  Click on the column header
name to sort the games in ascending order by that column.  Click on the same column again
to sort the games in descending order by that column.</p>

<p>You may also filter the game list by column(s).  Filters may be applied to any column
from a combo box below its title.  You may select a pre-defined filter from the drop-down list of the
combo box or define your own filter by typing one in the combo box.  Filters restrict the game list
to only games that match the filter.  For instance, if you enter <i>Bob</i> in the game name column
filter, only games that begin with <i>Bob</i> will appear.  Certain columns support more advanced
filters that allow comparisons (<, <=, >, >=).  Check the sample filters for each column to see examples
of what is supported.  To remove filtering for a column, select <i>No Filter</i> from the drop-down list.</p>

<p>You may also add your own custom filters and remove filters (including sample filters) for each
column.  To add, enter the filter in the combo box and select <i>Add</i> in the drop-down list.  To
remove a filter, select select the filter from the drop-down list or enter the filter in the combo box,
then select <i>Remove</i> in the drop-down list.  You may reset all filters to their default list
in the
<a href="OptionsTab.html">Options Tab</a>.</p>
