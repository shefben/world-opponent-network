<h3 align=center>Chat</h3>
<p>Chat allows discussions between the players in a given room or game staging area.  It is
available in several locations of the matchmaking system including the
<a href="LobbyTab.html">Lobby Tab</a> and multiple locations on the
<a href="GameTab.html">Game Tab</a>.  

<p>Chat is made up of several controls: the <a href="#_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a>, the
<a href="#_RefChatCmdBox">Chat Command Box</a>, and the <a href="#_RefUserList">User List</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a></h4>
<p>The Chat Window displays all chat from each user in the room.  User name is displayed
in a different color than chat text.  You may left-click on a user name to display a popup menu of
available <a href="#_RefCommands">commands</a>.  Note that some of the popup commands
create a partial command in the <a href="#_RefChatCmdBox">Chat Command Box</a>;
you must complete the command before sending it.</p>

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefChatCmdBox">Chat Command Box</a></h4>
<p>The Chat Command Box is located below the <a href="#_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a> and consists of
an <i>Edit</i> box and a <i>Send</i> button.  Enter your chat and <a href="#_RefCommands">commands</a> here.  Hit
<i>Return</i> or press the <i>Send</i> button to send your chat or execute the chat command.  Simply typing
text is considered normal chat that is sent to all users in the room.  Chat commands are proceeded
by a slash ('/'); any text that begins with a slash is considered a chat command.</p>

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefUserList">User List</a></h4>
<p>There is a User List associated with each <a href="#_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a>; usually located
to the right of the chat window.  The User List displays a list of all users in the chat room. You
may right-click on a user name to display a popup menu of available <a href="#_RefCommands">commands</a>.
Note that some of the popup commands will create a partial command in the
<a href="#_RefChatCmdBox">Chat Command Box</a>; you must complete the command before sending it.</p>

<p>Each user may have an <a href="icons.html">icon</a> to its left showing additional state.  Note
that moderators and administrators will sort to the top of the User List, followed by any
<a href="Friends.html">friends</a>, followed by other users in the chat room; moderators, friends,
and other users are separated by dividers within the User List.</p>

<p><a href="#_RefTop">Return to Top</a></p>

<h4><a name="_RefCommands">Chat Commands</a></h4>
<p>There are many chat commands available for use.  Any text that begins with a slash in the
<a href="#_RefChatCmdBox">Chat Command Box</a> is considered a chat command.  Unknown or invalid
commands will generate an error displayed in the <a href="#_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Several chat commands are available via entries in popup menus when a user name is
clicked on in the <a href="_RefChatWin">Chat Window</a> or the <a href="#_RefUserList">User List</a>.
Also note that the <i>whisper</i> and <i>ignore</i> commands are available via buttons at the bottom
of the User list.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Only the <i>Emote</i>, <i>Ignore</i>, <i>Reply</i>, and <i>Whisper</i> commands are
available in chat when playing via <a href="LanTab.html">LAN</a> or
<a href="DirectTab.html">Direct Connect</a>. All commands are available when playing via Sierra Online.</p>

<p>  The following table summarizes the
available chat commands:</p>
